# About

This is a mini project that I used to learn about the file system module as well as event emitters in Node.js.

## FS module

The 'createReadStream' function helps to open a file as a readable stream which opens up an event emitter. I learnt about the 'pipe()' emitter that basically structures the conversion of data into the desired output

## Data and csv-parser

The data is in form of comma separated values (.csv) and so the 'csv-parser' package was used. This package provides a parse function that takes an object to specify key parameters during the parse process.
